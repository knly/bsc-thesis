abstract = {We study the effects of a modified speed of gravitational waves (tensor modes), \$c\_T\^{}2\$ on the B-modes of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy in polarisation. We find that a departure from the light speed value would leave a characteristic imprint on the BB spectrum part induced by tensors, manifesting as a shift in the angular scale of its peaks. We derive constraints by using the available Planck and BICEP2 datasets showing how \$c\_T\^{}2\$ can be measured, albeit obtaining weak constraints due to the overall poor accuracy of the current BB power spectrum measurements. The present constraint corresponds to \$c\_T\^{}2 = 1.30 \backslash pm 0.79\$ and \$c\_T\^{}2< 2.85\$ at \$95\backslash\%\$ C.L. by assuming a power law primordial tensor power spectrum and \$c\_T\^{}2<2.33\$ at \$95\backslash\%\$ C.L. if the running of the spectral index is allowed. We derive forecasts for the next generation CMB satellites, which we find capable of tightly constraining \$c\_T\^{}2\$ at percent level, comparable with bounds from binary pulsar measurements, largely due to the absence of degeneracy with other cosmological parameters.},

@article{Pettorino2014,
abstract = {Modified gravity theories predict in general a non standard equation for the propagation of gravitational waves. Here we discuss the impact of modified friction and speed of tensor modes on cosmic microwave polarization B modes. We show that the non standard friction term, parametrized by \$\backslash alpha\_\{M\}\$, is degenerate with the tensor-to-scalar ratio \$r\$, so that small values of \$r\$ can be compensated by negative constant values of \$\backslash alpha\_M\$. We quantify this degeneracy and its dependence on the epoch at which \$\backslash alpha\_\{M\}\$ is different from the standard, zero, value and on the speed of gravitational waves \$c\_\{T\}\$. In the particular case of scalar-tensor theories, \$\backslash alpha\_\{M\}\$ is constant and strongly constrained by background and scalar perturbations, \$0\backslash le \backslash alpha\_\{M\}< 0.01\$ and the degeneracy with \$r\$ is removed. In more general cases however such tight bounds are weakened and the B modes can provide useful constraints on early-time modified gravity.},

abstract = {The aim of these lectures is to describe the physics of the relic radiation in cosmology, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in the framework of the theory of relativistic linear cosmological perturbations. At the end of the course, a student should be able to understand most of the modern scientific papers on this matter, ranging from the theoretical details of the CMB anisotropies, down to the physical content and implications of the current experimental data. In this chapter, we give an overview of the course, specifying the most important literature to look at, as well as reviewing the plan of the lectures. In the end, we also fix the notation we adopt, and introduce very basic elements of general relativity.},

@article{Amendola2014,
abstract = {We explore the impact of modified gravity on B-modes, identifying two main separate effects: lensing and propagation of tensor modes. The location of the inflationary peak of the BB spectrum depends on the speed of gravitational waves; the amplitude of the lensing contribution depends on the anisotropic stress. We single out these effects using the quasi-static regime and considering models for which the background and the growth of matter perturbations are standard. Using available data we obtain that the gravitational wave speed is compatible with the speed of light and constrained to within about 10\%.},

@article{Martin2012,
abstract = {This article aims at discussing the cosmological constant problem at a pedagogical but fully technical level. We review how the vacuum energy can be regularized in flat and curved space-time and how it can be understood in terms of Feynman bubble diagrams. In particular, we show that the properly renormalized value of the zero-point energy density today (for a free theory) is in fact far from being 122 orders of magnitude larger than the critical energy density, as often quoted in the literature. We mainly consider the case of scalar fields but also treat the cases of fermions and gauge bosons which allows us to discuss the question of vacuum energy in super-symmetry. Then, we discuss how the cosmological constant can be measured in cosmology and constrained with experiments such as measurements of planet orbits in our solar system or atomic spectra. We also review why the Lamb shift and the Casimir effect seem to indicate that the quantum zero-point fluctuations are not an artifact of the quantum field theory formalism. We investigate how experiments on the universality of free fall can constrain the gravitational properties of vacuum energy and we discuss the status of the weak equivalence principle in quantum mechanics, in particular the Colella, Overhauser and Werner experiment and the quantum Galileo experiment performed with a Salecker-Wigner-Peres clock. Finally, we briefly conclude with a discussion on the solutions to the cosmological constant problem that have been proposed so far. Â© 2012.},

@article{Burgess2013,
abstract = {These notes present a brief introduction to `naturalness' problems in cosmology, and to the Cosmological Constant Problem in particular. The main focus is the `old' cosmological constant problem, though the more recent variants are also briefly discussed. Several notions of naturalness are defined, including the closely related ideas of technical naturalness and `t Hooft naturalness, and it is shown why these naturally arise when cosmology is embedded within a framework --- effective field theories --- that efficiently captures what is consistent with what is known about the physics of smaller distances. Some care is taken to clarify conceptual issues, such as the relevance or not of quadratic divergences, about which some confusion has arisen over the years. A set of minimal criteria are formulated against which proposed solutions to the problem can be judged, and a brief overview made of the general limitations of most of the approaches. A somewhat more in-depth discussion is provided of what I view as the most promising approach. These notes are aimed at graduate students with a basic working knowledge of quantum field theory and cosmology, but with no detailed knowledge of particle physics.},
