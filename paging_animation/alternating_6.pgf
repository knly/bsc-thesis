%% To include the figure in your LaTeX document, write
%%   \input{<filename>.pgf}
%%
%% Make sure the required packages are loaded in your preamble
%%   \usepackage{pgf}
%%
%% Figures using additional raster images can only be included by \input if
%% they are in the same directory as the main LaTeX file. For loading figures
%% from other directories you can use the `import` package
%%   \usepackage{import}
%% and then include the figures with
%%   \import{<path to file>}{<filename>.pgf}
%%
%% Matplotlib used the following preamble
%%   \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
%%   \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
%%   \newcommand{\alphaM}{{\alpha_{\mathrm{M}}}}
%%   \newcommand{\alphaMnot}{{\alpha_{\mathrm{M}0}}}
%%   \newcommand{\cT}{{c_{\mathrm{T}}}}
%%   \newcommand{\betaexp}{\beta}
%%   \newcommand{\ofmetr}[1]{_#1}
%%   \newcommand{\alphaMofmetr}[1]{\alphaM\ofmetr{#1}}
%%   \newcommand{\mofmetr}[1]{m\ofmetr{#1}}
%%   \newcommand{\cTofmetr}[1]{\cT\ofmetr{#1}}
