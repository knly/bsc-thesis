- **Abstract:** Modified gravity theories generally aim to solve part of the *cosmological constant problem* by providing self-accelerating cosmological solutions without a cosmological constant. Such modifications of general relativity also affect the evolution of gravitational waves in the proposed theory. Instead of focussing on an explicit model, I introduce parametric modifications to the evolution equation of gravitational waves in both unimetric and bimetric settings and investigate their effect on the evolution of tensor perturbation modes. In particular, I argue that any modified gravity theory that exhibits *growing tensor modes* in cosmological evolution can be in tension with experiments. Therefore, parametric constraints for the physical viability of a general modified gravity theory can be found such that tensor modes remain within limits set by observations.


## Typesetting

Typeset this document with the [XeLaTeX](http://www.xelatex.org/) typesetting engine and the [Biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net) bibliography processor.

Adjust the following `documentclass` options to produce appropriate digital and print versions of the document:

- `digital` / `print` toggles e.g. link coloring and page number positioning
- `oneside` / `twoside` according to print layout
- `openright` / `openleft` / `openany` adjusts positioning of title page and chapter beginnings in twosided layout

If necessary for binding, adjust the page offset:
```tex
\geometry{
	bindingoffset=5mm,
}
```
